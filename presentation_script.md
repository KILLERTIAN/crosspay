# CrossPay Application Presentation Script

## Introduction (2 minutes)

Hello everyone! Today I'm excited to present **CrossPay**, our innovative blockchain-powered application for cross-border payments. CrossPay represents a significant advancement in international money transfers by leveraging Real World Asset (RWA) tokenization and the Pharos blockchain network.

Traditional cross-border payments face several key challenges:
- High fees (typically 3-10%)
- Slow settlement times (3-5 business days)
- Lack of transparency
- Limited accessibility

CrossPay solves these problems through blockchain technology, specifically using RWA tokenization, which allows us to represent real-world currencies as digital tokens on the Pharos Network.

## How It Works Page (2 minutes)

Now let's briefly look at how CrossPay works behind the scenes:

1. **RWA Tokenization**: Real-world assets (like USD, EUR, etc.) are represented as tokens on the blockchain, providing price stability unlike volatile cryptocurrencies.

2. **Cross-Border Process**: 
   - The sender's local currency is converted to RWA tokens
   - These tokens are transferred instantly on the Pharos blockchain
   - The recipient receives the equivalent amount in their local currency

3. **Regulatory Compliance**: Our system automatically handles KYC/AML requirements for each jurisdiction, ensuring full compliance without burdening users.

## Pharos Network Integration (3 minutes)

A critical component of our platform is its integration with the Pharos Network.

1. **Network Selection**: We support both Pharos Testnet and Devnet:
   - Testnet (Chain ID: 688688)
   - Devnet (Chain ID: 50002)

2. **Wallet Connection**: Our platform integrates seamlessly with popular web3 wallets through RainbowKit, providing a user-friendly experience for both crypto-natives and newcomers.

3. **Technical Infrastructure**:
   - The WalletProvider component in our codebase configures these networks
   - We have custom RPC configurations for special handling requirements
   - Our smart contracts are deployed and ready for interaction
